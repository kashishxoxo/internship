## Comprehensive Data Cleaning Report (Using Excel)

As part of the data preparation process, I carried out a series of data cleaning tasks in Excel to ensure the dataset is accurate, consistent, and analysis-ready. Below are the key steps I followed:

Identification and Handling of Missing Values I used Excel’s filter functions to identify missing or blank entries across key columns. Depending on the nature of the data, I either removed incomplete rows or flagged them for further review. This step was crucial in ensuring that no invalid or misleading records affect downstream analysis.

Removal of Duplicate Records To prevent redundancy and potential skewing of insights, I utilized Excel’s built-in “Remove Duplicates” feature. This helped in eliminating repeated entries based on key identifiers, preserving only the most relevant and unique data.

Standardization of Text Fields I cleaned and standardized textual data, particularly fields like gender, country names, and category labels. This included unifying variations (e.g., "Male" vs. "male", or "USA" vs. "United States") to a consistent format, which improves grouping and filtering accuracy during analysis.

Date Format Normalization All date columns were converted into a consistent format (dd-mm-yyyy). This ensures uniformity across records and allows for more effective sorting, filtering, and time-based analysis.

Column Header Cleanup To enhance readability and consistency, I reformatted column headers by renaming them to lowercase and removing any spaces or special characters. For example, “Date of Birth” became “date_of_birth”. This step also prepares the data for easier import into other tools if needed.

Data Type Verification and Correction I reviewed each column to confirm that the data types were appropriate. For instance, age fields were set to numeric formats, while date fields were validated to ensure they were properly recognized as date objects in Excel. Any incorrect formats were corrected to align with their intended data types.
