## Task 8 â€“ Sales Dashboard 
For this task, I created a simple interactive sales dashboard using Power BI.

## What I Did:
Imported the Superstore_Sales.csv dataset.

Cleaned and formatted the Order Date to Month-Year.

Created 3 main visuals:

- Line Chart for Sales over Months

- Bar Chart for Sales by Region

- Donut Chart for Sales by Category

- Added a slicer to filter by Region.


- Wrote 3 key insights based on the dashboard trends.
